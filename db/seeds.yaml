We brought with us two kids, that were a little sceptical in the beginning, but in the end they did not want to leave. Amazing food too of course. Better than any restaurant we have visited. I will give this experience my warmest recommendations."

He took so much time to answer all of our questions and was so helpful with not only educating us about the brewery, how the different beers are made. He took time to give us help finding great restaurants and places to make our vacation special. So my recommendation is. Go to this first on your trip. He was better than my travel agent Lol."

This is a good experience if you are looking for a very quick demo/overview of the gelato making process - it does not include much time to actually participate in the process, and took about 35-40 minutes total. We very much appreciate the warm welcome to our children."

I was able to share my passion for coffee and learn so many things I wouldn't have been able to learn otherwise. The best part about the experience was that it was hands-on in nature - I was able to touch and feel coffee beans through their different maturity stages, test different brewing methods, and most importantly ask questions that I wouldn't be able to ask my barista in the hustle and bustle of city life. I plan to come back for additional experiences once they are developed."

If you're looking for a unique, intimate, fun, and affordable culinary experience this is for you. Lina was awesome about planning the night for us and giving us a heads up about all the details. She asked us about some food preferences and even gave us wine recommendations. Jared is a brilliant chef, and you can tell that he's doing this because he loves it. Not only is he an excellent chef, he's also got an impressive knowledge about the science behind cooking and baking, and he is clearly passionate about sustainable agriculture and the restaurant/food industry. Together with Jared we made blue fish and beef tongue - which we paired with a selection of local vegetables/greens from Jared's garden and his neighborhood in JP. And for dessert we made macarons and butter cream cake. Our favorite part of the evening was chatting with Jared about the processes behind all the things we were making, the ingredients we were using, and soaking up all of his insights on everything from fish cookery to the details of baking the perfect macarons. We were blown away by Jared & Lina's hospitality, and Jared's passion for what he does. We couldn't believe that this 3+ hour experience was as affordable as it was... we would recommend it to any foodie or cook out there - whether you an experienced chef or not! Can't wait to go back for a second round :) PS: Jared even gave us a bunch of goodies on our way out - leftovers, recipe's, and some of his sourdough starter!"

Everyone had a chance to actually participate to make the dough and use the hand crank pasta machine. We loved getting to eat the pasta with his toppings, it gave us ideas of dishes to make in the future and we left excited to make pasta soon. You HAVE to go on the rooftop after, we brought our own wine and finished it on the roof with incredible views of the city. Definitely recommending this experience to friends !"
